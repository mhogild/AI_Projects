# 💬 Project 3 – Automated Customer Dialog with Manychat and Zapier

## 🔍 Business Case

Restaurants and service-oriented businesses often receive large volumes of customer inquiries — especially regarding table reservations or general service requests. These are typically handled manually, which:

- Ties up staff  
- Increases response time  
- Introduces risk of errors or missed messages  

**The solution in this project:**  
An automated setup that handles customer inquiries without human intervention, while remaining scalable, reliable, and cost-efficient.

## 🎯 Relevance Across Industries

This setup can help organizations:

- **Automate customer communication** — Customers receive fast, helpful, and friendly responses without burdening support or administrative teams.
- **Scale to new locations and languages** — without requiring additional staff, supporting both expansion and global presence.
- **Maintain consistency and availability** — answering questions around the clock, even outside normal business hours.

This type of solution is useful in hospitality, retail, event planning, and service sectors — and can serve both small businesses and global enterprises.

## ⚙️ Manychat Automation

**Manychat**, which handles incoming inquiries, is integrated with **Zapier** to automatically manage requests such as reservations or service questions.

When a customer asks about availability (e.g., for a table), Zapier checks the schedule or database and, if there is space, the system applies smart logic to allocate the request. The user then receives an automated response via Manychat — no human involvement needed.

This setup ensures:

- Fast replies
- Reliable communication flow
- Seamless handoff between systems and channels
